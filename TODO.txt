1) Fix issue with threshold: Find way to ignore changes less than threshold

2) Look at smallestDiff again (negatives)

3) Switch back to log base e for approximating small percent diff

4) Cant enforce threshold when checking edge, since we are not garuenteed to
   have that edge in the cycle. Somehting needs to inerhnetly change aabout the
   weights.

   # Rough Work: 

   Goal: Only record profit that is larger than 1% diff. 

   Issue: We are not garunteed to get the cycle with the edge we landed on. 

   Ideas: During run(), only record new distance if it is at least 1 diff.m
   Therefore all negative cycle would be at least 1 diff


   Maybe profits mapping to incorrect rates?

   API keys are cooked?
